              Objective
              Geocoding and characterizing geographic, community, and environmental characteristics of study participants is frequently done in epidemiological studies. However, participant addresses are identifiable protected health information ({PHI}) and geocoding must be conducted in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant manner. Our objective was to create a software application for this process that addresses limitations in current approaches.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              We used a containerization platform to create {DeGAUSS} (Decentralized Geomarker Assessment for Multi-Site Studies), a software application that facilitates reproducible geocoding and geomarker assessment while maintaining the confidentiality of {PHI}. To validate the software, 215 350 addresses in Hamilton County, Ohio, were geocoded using {DeGAUSS}, {ArcGIS}, Google, and {SAS} and compared to a gold-standard approach. We distributed the {DeGAUSS} software to sites in an ongoing multisite study (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics, or {eMERGE}), and individual sites independently geocoded and assigned median census tract–level income and distance to nearest major roadway to their participants’ addresses, removed associated {PHI}, and returned deidentified data.
            
            
              Results
              Within a multisite study, 52 244 study participants’ addresses across 5 sites were geocoded with a median distance to roadway of 10 022m and a median census tract income of \$57 266, demonstrating the feasibility of {DeGAUSS} within a multisite study. Compared to other commonly used geocoding platforms, {DeGAUSS} had similar geocoding and geomarker assessment accuracies.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The open source {DeGAUSS} software overcomes multiple challenges in the use of address data in multisite studies and also serves as a more general reproducible research tool for geocoding and geomarker assessment.},

	abstract = {Geocoding, the process of converting textual information describing a location into one or more digital geographic representations, is a routine task performed at large organizations and government agencies across the globe. In a health context, this task is often a fundamental first step performed prior to all operations that take place in a spatially-based health study. As such, the quality of the geocoding system used within these agencies is of paramount concern to the agency (the producer) and researchers or policy-makers who wish to use these data (consumers). However, geocoding systems are continually evolving with new products coming on the market continuously. Agencies must develop and use criteria across a number axes when faced with decisions about building, buying, or maintaining any particular geocoding systems. To date, published criteria have focused on one or more aspects of geocode quality without taking a holistic view of a geocoding system’s role within a large organization. The primary purpose of this study is to develop and test an evaluation framework to assist a large organization in determining which geocoding systems will meet its operational needs. A geocoding platform evaluation framework is derived through an examination of prior literature on geocoding accuracy. The framework developed extends commonly used geocoding metrics to take into account the specific concerns of large organizations for which geocoding is a fundamental operational capability tightly-knit into its core mission of processing health data records. A case study is performed to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of five geocoding platforms currently available in the Australian geospatial marketplace. The evaluation framework developed in this research is proven successful in differentiating between key capabilities of geocoding systems that are important in the context of a large organization with significant investments in geocoding resources. Results from the proposed methodology highlight important differences across all axes of geocoding system comparisons including spatial data output accuracy, reference data coverage, system flexibility, the potential for tight integration, and the need for specialized staff and/or development time and funding. Such results can empower decisions-makers within large organizations as they make decisions and investments in geocoding systems.},
